# To-Do App

This is a simple To-Do app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This README provides an overview of the project structure and how to run the app on your local machine. You can also check it out live here https://todo-app-phi-five.vercel.app/

## Getting Started

To run this To-Do app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code as a ZIP file.
2. Extract the files to a directory of your choice.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

Alternatively, you can use a local web server to serve the files.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `index.html`: The HTML file that contains the structure of the app.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that defines the styles for the app.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the logic of the app.

## Usage

1. When you open the app, you will see an input field and a "Add Task" button.
2. Type your task in the input field and click "Add Task" or press Enter to add the task to the list.
3. The task will be displayed in the "Tasks" section.
4. To mark a task as completed, click the checkbox next to the task.
5. To delete a task, click the "Delete" button next to the task.
6. You can filter the tasks by their completion status using the "All," "Active," and "Completed" buttons at the bottom.
7. To clear all completed tasks, click the "Clear Completed" button.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the app to fit your needs. Here are a few ideas:

- Modify the styles in `style.css` to change the appearance of the app.
- Add additional functionality, such as due dates or priority levels for tasks.
- Store tasks in local storage to persist them across page refreshes.
- Implement a search feature to filter tasks by their content.
